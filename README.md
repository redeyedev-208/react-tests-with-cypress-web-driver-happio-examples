# React testing examples with jest, cypress, webdriver, happio and happoio
This repo is mainly for keeping notes on various testing approaches. Ranging from jest unit tests,  to adding automated tests via cypress, webdriver and happoio. 
These tests will also be added to mimic the workflow that exists in a live production envronment. Where they will pushed up into our CI via github.

The usage of snap shots is a subjective discussion but can come in handy to check on the responsiveness of websites. Allowing an application to mimic the usage or various devices. With the mobile first approach, to not test that the device is hitting the breakpoints allows for a check if there isn't an actual mobile view.
